RUNNING
==========

To run the generator, the primary executable is in src/wsnsim/generatory.py.
Execute it with the -h option to see potential arguments.  For example, to 
use the evualation included with the distribution, an example command is:

$ python src/wsnsim/generator.py -f evualation/network_sim.conf -s evualation/NetworkPerformancetry.tcl -d output -u submit.dag

Then, to submit the simulations, run the command
$ condor_submit_dag submit.dag
